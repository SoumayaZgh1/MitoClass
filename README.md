## üîç Overview

The morphology of the mitochondrial network is a key indicator of cellular health and function, with structural changes often associated with various physiological and pathological conditions. Efficient and quantitative analysis of mitochondrial shapes in microscopy data is therefore crucial in life sciences and biomedical research.

**MitoClass** addresses this need by offering an automated, fast, and user-friendly solution for mitochondrial morphology classification.

##  Key Features

- üî¨ **Automated classification** of mitochondrial networks into three morphological categories:
  - Fragmented
  - Intermediate
  - Elongated
-  Trained on curated super-resolution microscopy data, including high- and low-resolution samples.
-  Built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate and robust predictions.
-  Offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use ‚Äî no coding required.
-  Includes visualization of results and class distribution charts.
